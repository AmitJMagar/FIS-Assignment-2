# FIS-Assignment-2 Min Max Algorithm and Mim Max Algorithm with alpha beta prunning

(Tic-Tac-Toe) Write a Python program, ttt.py that plays tic-tac-toe against a human opponent, with the human player moving first (‘X’).   
• The program will show all states of the game board.
• Have your program choose its moves use 1) regular Minimax, and 2) Minimax using alpha-beta pruning. Report the chosen move and number of search tree nodes generated by both algorithms.

• Provide a README (text file) explaining how to 1) run your program, and 2) in- terpret the output of your program.

• In your write-up, provide output from two complete games.
